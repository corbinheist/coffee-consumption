    - How Exactly is it collected?
    - Hoow often is it updated?
    - where does it go next?
3. What does the data in this field actuall look like?
4. Are there any caveats to keep in mind when using this data?
5. Where can I go to get more information?

Table: the table name, exactly the way it appears in the database
Table Notes: general notes on the table, like the theme of the data in the table, how often it gets updated, and where it comes from
Field: the field name, exactly as it appears in the database
Definition: a user-friendly (often long-form) definition of the field
Example value: used to show what data in that field actually looks like
Field notes: general notes on the field, sometimes including values, caveats or notes of interest, and places (like tables) to find more information about that field
